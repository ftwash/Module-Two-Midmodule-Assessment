      <!-- Build a website with the following user stories:

      - As a user I can select how many dice I want to roll
      - As a user, I can click a button to roll that many dice
      - As a user, I can view the dice roll as well as its sum
      - As a user, I can view the history of all of my previous rolls and their sums
      
      ## Testing notes:
      
      - Your history items should be `li` elements.
      - Clicking the roll button the first time should not add anything to the history
      - Subsequent clicks to the rolls button should add the previous roll to the history
      - The only `li` elements should be your history dice rolls
      - You should have exactly one `input` element where the number of dice can be entered
      - You should have exactly one `button` element that the user can click on to roll the dice
      - The die result from rolling should be stored in an element with the id "dice-para"
      - The sum from rolling should be stored in an element with the id "sum-para"
      - Use the follow HTML entity values for dice:
       -->
<h2>History</h2>


  </body>
</html>



<!-- later steps:

â€¢create a box around the dice results and the history sections
